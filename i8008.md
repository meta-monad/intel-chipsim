# Notes about the intel 8008 chip

## Architecture

The chip can address 16K (16,384 bytes) of RAM with its 14 bit addresses split in two cycles, communicated to the rest of the machinery through its 8 bit data bus. Address go from low bit to high bit for compatibility with Datapoint. The chip first sends out the lower 8 bits, and then the higher 6 bits (with the remaining two, D6 & D7 being used as control signals)

### Machine state

Externally, the machine signals states 8 states: T1, T1I, T2, WAIT, T3, STOPPED, T4, T5. But internally, it only uses T1-T5. The external state is encoded by the S0-S2 pins.

A T-state is 2 clock cycles:
- SNYC 1 to 0
- f11, f10, f21, f20

Instructions might take 1,2, or 3 machine cycles to complete. First cycle is the *instruction fetch cycle* (PCI). The second and third are either *data reading* (PCR), *data writing* (PCW), *I/O operations* (PCC). The cycles are encoded in the D6 & D7 pins.

### Scratchpad Memory

The scratchpad file contains an 8-bit accumulator called A and six additional 8-bit registers called B,C,D,E,H, and L.  

There is one pseudoregister, M, which can be used interchangeably with the scratchpad registers. M is, in effect, that particular byte in memory whose address is currently contained in H and L (L contains the eight loworder bits of the address and Hcontains the six high-order bits). Thus, M is a byte in memory and not a register.

The four flags in the 8008 are CARRY, ZERO, SIGN, and PARITY.

- The CARRY flag indicates if a carry-out or borrow-in was generated, thereby providing a multiple-precision binary arithmetic capability.
- The ZERO flag indicates whether or not the result is zero. This provides the ability to compare two values for equality.   
- The SIGN flag reflects the setting of the leftmost bit of the result.
- The PARITY flag indicates whether the result is ofeven or odd parity.

### Address stack

Composed of 8 x 14 bit registers. One register is used for the program counter. Others permit nesting of up to 7 levels. A three-bit address pointer is used to designate the present location of the program counter.

When the capacity of the stack is exceeded the address. pointer recycles and the content of the lowest level register is destroyed.

The execution of a call instruction causes the next address register to become the current program counter, and the return instruction causes the address register that last served as the program counter to again become the program counter. The stack will wrap around if subroutines are nested more than seven levels deep. 

The program counter is incremented immediately after the lower order address bits are sent out (T1). The higher order address bits are sent out at T2 and then incremented if a carry resulted from T1.

### Operands

Types of operands:

- immediate: 1 byte opcode + 1 byte operand
- register operand:  1 byte = opcode + reg OR opcode + reg + opcode
- memory operand: register operand on register M
- jump/call: 1 byte opcode + 1 byte low address + 6 bits high address (X X D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0)

#### Addressing registers

|register|binary|
|----|----|
|A|000|
|B|001|
|C|010|
|D|011|
|E|100|
|H|101|
|L|110|

Implicitly, 111 is refering to M.

### Instruction Set

The instruction set consists of *scratchpad-register* instructions, *accumulator-specific* instructions, *transfer-of-control* instructions, *input/output* instructions, and *processor-control* instructions.

- Scratchpad-register instructions modify registers (M too). These include increment/decrement.
- Transfer-of-control consists of jumps, calls, and returns. Can be conditional or unconditional.
- I/O selects a specific port and copies the accumulator register to the data bus.
- Processor control has halt and no-op.  Halt puts the processor into a waiting state. The processor remains in that state until an interrupt occurs. No-op does nothing, (interally, the CPU is supposed to move the accumulator into the accumulator).

### Interrupts

When calling an interrup (setting the INTERRUPT line to 1), you can force an instruction (can be multiple bytes) into execution. Since the program counter isn't incremented, the instruction in memory that didn't get fetched won't be skipped. The instruction typically supplied by the interrupting device is a CALL, so that an interrupt service routine can be entered and then the main program can be resumed after interrupt processing is complete. Inserting a jump instruction would result in the main program address being lost.

With the RST instruction (one byte), the PC is saved into the pushdown stack, and PC is set to 00AAA000 = n << 3. So the values are 0x00, 0x08, 0x10, 0x18, 0x20, 0x28, 0x30, 0x38.

## Startup

Power and f1 and f2 are turned on. This forces a HTL instruction (0x00) into the chip, which causes the CPU to signal a STOPPED state (internally a T3). It should take 16 cycles for the scratchpads and flags to clear to 0. When the interrupt line is set to 1, it is decoded by setting it to 0 and going into the T1I state. As this is an interrupt, PC is not incremented.

There is a choice to be made after that in terms of what instruction to push into the chip. The most convenient way is with the RST instruction to jump to the main program. Alternatively, a NOP (11 000 000 / Laa) can be used and let the chip enter into the main program at 0x00. And finally, RST can be used to run a startup routine that RETURNs to the main program.

### Normal operation


(internal states T1-T5)
- T1:
    - the lower 8 bits of the address are sent out
- T2:
    - the higher 6 bits of the address are sent out
- T3:
    - chips stalls if HLT instruction or RDY input not being set
    - if the operand calls for it, return to T1
- T4-T5: chip operations
