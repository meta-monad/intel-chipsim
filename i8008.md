# Notes about the intel 8008 chip

## Architecture

The chip can address 16K (16,384 bytes) of RAM with its 14 bit addresses. The address is read in in two internal cycles (T1 & T2), where the chip communicates with the memory controller through its 8 bit data bus. Addresses are big endian for compatibility with Datapoint's hardware. The chip first sends out the lower 8 bits, and then the higher 6 bits (with the remaining two, D6 & D7 being used as control signals).

### Machine state

Externally, the machine signals states 8 states: T1, T1I, T2, WAIT, T3, STOPPED, T4, T5. But internally, it only uses T1-T5. The external state is encoded by the S0-S2 pins.

A T-state is composed of 2 clock cycles:
- SNYC 1 to 0
- f11 -> f10 -> f21 -> f20

Instructions might take 1, 2, or 3 machine cycles to complete. First cycle is the *instruction fetch cycle* (PCI). The second and third are either for *data reading* (PCR), *data writing* (PCW), or *I/O operations* (PCC). The cycles are encoded in the D6 & D7 pins during T2. The use of those two pins is the reason for the 14 bit memory addresses instead of the full 16 bit that two cycles would provide.

### Scratchpad Memory

The scratchpad file contains an 8-bit accumulator register called A and six additional 8-bit registers called B, C, D, E, H, and L.

There is one pseudoregister, M, which most of the time can be used interchangeably with the scratchpad registers. M is, in effect, that particular byte in memory whose address is currently contained in H and L, where L contains the eight lower bits of the address and H contains the six higher bits.

The four flags in the 8008 are CARRY, ZERO, SIGN, and PARITY.

- The CARRY flag indicates if a carry-out or borrow-in was generated.
- The ZERO flag indicates whether or not the result is zero. This provides the ability to compare two values for equality with the compare instruction.
- The SIGN flag reflects the setting of the leftmost bit of the result.
- The PARITY flag indicates whether the result is ofeven or odd parity.

### Address stack

Composed of 8 x 14 bit registers, one register is used for the program counter. The other seven allow for nesting of up to 7 levels. A three-bit address pointer is used to designate the present location of the program counter.

When the capacity of the stack is exceeded, the address pointer recycles and the content of the lowest level register is destroyed. Hence, the stack will wrap around if subroutines are nested more than seven levels deep. 

The execution of a call instruction causes the next address register to become the current program counter, and the return instruction causes the address register that last served as the program counter to again become the program counter.

The program counter is incremented immediately after the lower order address bits are sent out (T1). The higher order address bits are sent out at T2 and then incremented if a carry resulted from T1.

### Operands

Types of operands:

- immediate: 1 byte opcode + 1 byte operand
- register operand:  1 byte = opcode + reg OR opcode + reg + opcode
- memory operand: register operand on register M
- jump/call: 1 byte opcode + 1 byte low address + 6 bits high address (X X D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0)

#### Addressing registers

|register|binary|
|----|----|
|A|000|
|B|001|
|C|010|
|D|011|
|E|100|
|H|101|
|L|110|

Implicitly, 111 is refering to M.

#### Addressing flags

This conversion is used with conditional jump, call, and return instructions, usually paired with a "truth bit" (to execute the instruction when the flag is false, or when it's true).

|flag|binary|
|----|----|
|carry|00|
|zero|01|
|sign|10|
|parity|11|

### Instruction Set

The instruction set consists of *scratchpad-register* instructions, *accumulator-specific* instructions, *transfer-of-control* instructions, *input/output* instructions, and *processor-control* instructions.

- Scratchpad-register instructions modify registers (M too). These also include increment/decrement, which are ALU operations that set the flags.
- Transfer-of-control consists of jumps, calls, and returns. Can be conditional or unconditional.
- I/O selects a specific port and copies the accumulator register to the databus or reads from the databus to the accumulator register.
- Processor control has halt and no-op.  Halt puts the processor into a waiting state. The processor remains in that state until an interrupt occurs. No-op does nothing, (interally, the CPU is supposed to move the accumulator into the accumulator).

### Interrupts

When calling an interrup (by setting the Interrupt line to 1), you can force an instruction (can be multiple bytes) into execution. Since the program counter isn't incremented, the instruction in memory that didn't get fetched won't be skipped. The instruction typically supplied by the interrupting device is a CAL, so that an interrupt service routine can be entered and then the main program can be resumed after interrupt processing is complete. Inserting a jump instruction would result in the main program address being lost.

With the RST instruction (one byte), the PC is saved into the pushdown stack, and program counter is set to 00AAA000 = n << 3 (with the higher bits all set to 0). These three bits provide the predetermined jump locations of 0x00, 0x08, 0x10, 0x18, 0x20, 0x28, 0x30, and 0x38.

## Startup

Power and f1 and f2 are turned on. This forces a HTL instruction (0x00) into the chip, which causes the CPU to signal a STOPPED state (internally a T3). It should take 16 cycles for the scratchpads and flags to clear to 0. When the interrupt line is set to 1, it is decoded by setting it to 0 and going into the T1I state. As this is an interrupt, PC is not incremented.

There is a choice to be made after that in terms of what instruction to push into the chip. The most convenient way is with the RST instruction to jump to the main program. Alternatively, a NOP (11 000 000 / Laa) can be used and let the chip enter into the main program at 0x00. And finally, RST can be used to run a startup routine that returns to the main program.

### Normal operation

(internal states T1-T5)
- T1:
    - the lower 8 bits of the address are sent out
- T2:
    - the higher 6 bits of the address are sent out
- T3:
    - chips stalls if HLT instruction or RDY input not being set
    - if the operand calls for it, return to T1
- T4-T5: chip operations

## Implementation

My goal with this project was to be as close to the real thing as feasible. So instead of implementing a function that simply read the memory byte by byte and updated its state instantly accordingly to the instruction, the codebase maintains a full model of the chip's internals as seen in `src/i8008.rs`. In the real world, it is the responsibility of the external circuitry to correctly decode the addresses supplied by the microcontroller, and fetch the corresponding byte from the memory. In this codebase, the `step_with_mem` function locaded in `src/i8008.rs` provides this functionaly, but because the goal was the Intel 8008 microcontroller and not to simulate full systems like the SIM8-01 or Intellec 8, how one interacts with the chip might be wholey different.

In specific, the command line provides these utilities: 
- manually setting the Interrupt and Ready lines with the `set_line` command
- dumping the RAM contents with the `ram` command
- displaying a prettified status of the chip including all its registers, program stack, flags, cycle, and state with the `status` command
- executing a single step with the `step` command
- executing a full cycle with the `cycle` command, where the external control logic calls `step` until it reaches the STOPPED, WAIT, or T1.

Observe that the chip is frozen in time until the command line interpreter calls the `step_with_mem` function.

### Specific differences within the microcontroller

- The state is available in the form of an enum instead of being provided bit-by-bit on the S0, S1, and S2 pins.
- The cycle is always available in the form of an enum instead of being provided bit-by-bit on pins D6 and D7 during T2.
- For the jump and call instructions, there is an extra control bit used by the struct to differentiate between PCR cycle 1 and PCR cycle 2. This exception is because the documentation didn't mention anything on how these two states (which have different in function) are distinguished within the internal circuitry.
- I/O isn't implemented, partially due to overlapping instructions.
- On startup, the 16 machine cycles used to clear the registers is ignored.
- When providing the data in T3, it's provided in little-endian form for clearer code, the 14 bit address is still sent out properly.

### Startup

The external circuitry is set up without the use of interrupts except for the startup. This kept the code simple and is in line with what the user manual mentions. In a more sophisticated system, interrupts should be separately handled.

The microcontroller is initialized on the PCI cycle, STOPPED state, with the Ready line set (to indicate the availability of the memory). In the real world, there is a period of time spent clearing the registers (16 clock periods to be precise), which is ignored in this simulator.

With regards to starting up the microcontroller in the simulator, the following is the expected chain of operations:
- load assembly into memory, e.g. `load program.o`.
- set the Interrupt line with `set_line int high` (or a variation) for the chip to begin function. This knocks the microcontroller out of the STOPPED state that it starts with and grabs the instruction at memory address 0.
- continue operation with `cycle` or `step`.
